# Welcome to my github

Hi, I am Steve Wang, a Python/Typescript all-around web developer and data scientist, with a passion for learning and building new things. In a previous life, I trained as a biomedical engineer which later transitioned into data science. I now work on the virtual side of things, but hopefully can get my hands dirty once again ;)

## About Me

Began my career in academia, developing high-throughput imaging assays for immunotherapy drug screening. This research involved developing automated ML algorithms to classify millions of cytometric images at scale, which inspired me to move into data science and analytics. I've worn many hats in my career and thrive in interdisciplinary collaborative environments, which is why I'm always up for a challenge.
