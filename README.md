# 👋🏻 Welcome

Hi, I'm Steve, a Python/Typescript full-stack data scientist and web developer, with a passion for learning and building things that add value to people's lives. Of course, making money while doing so is a nice bonus :) In a previous life, I trained as a biomedical engineer which inspired my transition into data science. I now work on the virtual side of things, but hopefully can get my hands dirty once again ;)

## 🌎 About me

Began my career in academia, developing high-throughput assays for immunotherapy drug screening. This research involved automating ML algorithms to classify millions of cells at scale, which naturally connected to data science and analytics. I've worn many hats in my career and thrive in cross-functional collaborative environments, and am always up for a new challenge.
